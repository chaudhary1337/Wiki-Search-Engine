- search
    - binary search in search (and have index store file size at the top. also changes by +1 in line number) -> just realized - even if i store the #lines at the top of the file, i still have to read all of the lines into memory, worst case. might see this part later.
- general
    - check search for field and non-field queries
    - add readme with commands and file descriptions
    - run it once with the entire dataset
